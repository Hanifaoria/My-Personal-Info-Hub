    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Hanifa Oria. I am a curious and motivated student who loves learning new things every day. I believe that education is the key to success and personal growth. I enjoy exploring different subjects, asking questions, and trying to understand how the world works. Learning is not just something I do at school â€” it's something I truly enjoy in my daily life.</p>

    <p>I have a strong interest in technology, especially in learning how to write code and create websites. I enjoy designing simple web pages and understanding how they work. In the future, I hope to improve my skills in web development and maybe even build my own personal or business website. Coding makes me feel creative and confident.</p>
